--------------------------------------------------------------

**Role:** Consultant (Sample Project)
**Duration:** Feb 2024 - Present
**Technologies:** Oracle 12c/19c, PL/SQL, SQL*Loader, Unix Shell Scripting, Autosys, GitLab CI/CD

**Summary:**
Designed and delivered an automated inbound data-loading pipeline for banking use-cases. The solution
ingests CSV files via SQL*Loader into a staging table, executes PL/SQL validation, and moves validated
records to the target table. The pipeline is scheduled with Autosys and supported by GitLab CI/CD for
controlled deployments.

**Key Contributions:**
- Developed PL/SQL package for bulk validation and safe move of staging data to target tables.
- Implemented SQL*Loader control file and shell script to automate file ingestion and processing.
- Sample Autosys JIL included to demonstrate scheduling; logs and error captures included for monitoring.
- Created implementation and rollback plan; emphasized auditability and minimal manual intervention.

**Result / Impact (sample metrics):**
- Reduced manual file processing effort by ~80% (demo metric).
- Standardized validation and audit trail for inbound files.

**Repository:** Provide GitHub link after uploading repository (see README for instructions).
